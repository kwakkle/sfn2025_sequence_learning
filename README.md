## Overview  

This repository contains the full analysis pipeline used for my **2025 Society for Neuroscience poster**, where I examined how **wild-type (WT) and FMR1 knockout (KO) mice** learn and respond to sensory sequences, using behavioral licking analysis, generalized linear modeling, and wide-field calcium imaging.

Our central question:  
**How does Fragile X Syndrome alter the way the brain processes and learns predictable sensory sequences?**
